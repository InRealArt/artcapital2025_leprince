      "text2": "Nadine Le Prince, born in Paris, comes from a line of artists dating back to the 16th century, notably Jean-Baptiste Le Prince, painter to the Russian court in the 18th century and friend of Diderot. From an early age, she showed a talent for drawing and took up oil painting, painting still lifes, landscapes and portraits. At the age of 17, she exhibited her work for the first time, joining the Peintres de la Réalité group. Inspired by 17th-century painting, she updates this influence through composition and choice of subjects. Dividing her time between France and India, she explores the contrast between these two civilizations, a source of wonder and questioning. Her figurative painting, combining emotion and reflection, offers an appearance of reality in three dimensions, serving as a mirror of her inner self and an open window on the outside world."
